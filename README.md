# MATLAB Spring 2014 – Research Plan

* Group Name: Pineapple
* Group participants names: Lukas Bosshart, Damian Kissling
* Project Title: Simulation of different behaving ant colonies

## General Introduction

Our aim is, to simulate the gathering of food for ants. Therefore we create four ant colonies with different ant-behaviour. 
Further we will define four different environments for the food fight of the ant-colonies. They are different in food density and challenges like predators or environmental factors.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

* Which ant colony has the best properties and is therefore the most efficient?
* Which properties have a greater influence on the outcome of the simulation?
* Are there any parallels to actual ants?


## Expected Results

We expect, that the colonies that have a stronger focus on teamwork (with the use of pheromones) will have a big advantage and will work more efficient.
