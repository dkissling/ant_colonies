# MATLAB Spring 2014 â€“ Research Plan

> * Group Name: ****
> * Group participants names: Lukas Bosshart, Damian Kissling
> * Project Title: Trail simulation for national roads between major swiss cities

## General Introduction

Our group wants to simulate a possible road-system which could connect major swiss cities in an effective way depending on their population, as well as the distance and the geographical limitations between them.
The goal is to compare the simulated solution with the actual road-system.
Todo: [ ] Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
